# Smart Campus Assistant

## Overview

Smart Campus Assistant is an AI-powered academic query system designed to help students quickly access important campus-related information such as syllabus details, academic regulations, class timetables, notices, and placement information.

The system uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Llama 3.1, LangChain, and ChromaDB to retrieve accurate information from institutional documents and provide precise, context-aware responses through a user-friendly chat interface.

This project reduces manual searching through PDFs and improves student access to academic resources using intelligent document retrieval and semantic search.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-link>
cd smart-campus-assistant
```

### Create Virtual Environment

```bash
conda create -n sca python=3.10
conda activate sca
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Make sure `.env` is included in `.gitignore`.

---

## Run Vector Database Creation

Before starting the application:

```bash
python vectorize_documents.py
```

This will:

- Process PDFs and text files
- Create semantic chunks
- Generate embeddings
- Store vectors in ChromaDB

---

## Run the Application

### Streamlit UI

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

### FastAPI Backend

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

---

## Example Queries

### Syllabus

- course code of DBMS
- unit 3 of Machine Learning
- textbooks for DBMS
- units of autometa and compiler design

### Timetable

- subjects on Monday
- faculty names
- which subjects are scheduled on Thursday
- subjects and there course codes

### Regulations

- attendance rules
- how many rules
- list out the rules that need to be followed by the students in the campus
- code of conduct

---

## Future Improvements

- Role-based access for students and faculty
- Voice-based query interaction
- Multi-language support
- Department-specific personalization
- Mobile app integration
- Notice automation and placement alert system
- Admin dashboard for document management
